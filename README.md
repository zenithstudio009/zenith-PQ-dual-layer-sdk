#  Zenith Quantum Proof Dual-Signature Layer™
## Zenith Quantum Proof Dual-Signature Layer™ adds post-quantum protection to every blockchain transaction by generating a second signature alongside the standard ECDSA signature.

	•	ECDSA Signature (classical layer): Maintains compatibility with existing chains (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, Aptos, etc).
	•	PQC Signature (quantum-proof layer): Generated using NIST-approved CRYSTALS-Dilithium (digital signatures) and stored in an off-chain audit trail.
	•	Optional Encryption: CRYSTALS-Kyber (KEM) can be used to secure private key material or session keys.

## This makes Zenith the HTTPS moment for Web3 - future-proofing wallets, dApps, and exchanges against quantum attacks while also delivering immediate fraud detection and audit logs.



#  Features

	•	Dual-Signature: ECDSA + Dilithium
	•	Off-Chain PQC Audit Trail (immutable verification log)
	•	Kyber KEM for optional secure key exchange
	•	Chain-Agnostic SDK (works across EVM + non-EVM chains)
	•	Simple developer integration (Web3.js / ethers.js wrapper)
